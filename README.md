There is a [wonderful diagram from scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/1.3/tutorial/machine_learning_map/) that walks people through the process of choosing the right algorithm. I think that is a wonderful resource, and eventually I'd love to get to that point for the overall AI/ML space in the context of biology research. However, before guiding people to selecting things, I want to first just give them a sense of the territory, and what different approaches are used for.
